// decimal and byte[] are both supported PropertyKinds, but neither had a round-trip test — they
// appeared only in a PropertyModel constructed by hand and in a diagnostic test, so nothing ever
// wrote one to a Parquet stream and read it back.
//
// They are covered by the Native AOT matrix too, but that runs a natively compiled binary. Without
// coverage here, an ordinary functional break in either would be reported as an AOT failure, which
// points at entirely the wrong cause. These keep the layers honest: this file says "does it work",
// the AOT matrix says "does it still work compiled ahead of time".
