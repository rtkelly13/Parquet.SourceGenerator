// Shared by test/PackageConsumption (Parquet.Net 6.x, modern generator) and
// test/PackageConsumptionLegacy (Parquet.Net 4.25, classic generator) via <Compile Include=.../>.
//
// The point of sharing the source is that both packages then describe the *same* columns, so a file
// written by one can be handed to the other. That is the cross-version leg of the compatibility
// matrix (issue #168): the current generated writer read by a supported legacy consumer, and the
// legacy writer read by the current consumer — neither of which any in-solution test can cover,
// because a single test assembly can only reference one Parquet.Net at a time.
//
// Plain classes with settable properties on purpose: this source has to compile under the classic
// backend on net472 as well as the modern one on net8.0/net9.0.
