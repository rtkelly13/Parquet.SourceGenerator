# 07 - Known Limitations & Remediation Plan

An audit of the generator as it stands, recording what does not work, why, and what closing each
gap requires. Unlike the other documents in this folder — which describe intended design — this one
describes **observed behaviour**.

Findings come from reading `TargetParser`, `CodeEmitter` and the emitted code, and from inspecting
the published Parquet.Net packages on nuget.org. Items are marked ✅ once fixed, with the closing
commit's behaviour described inline.

**Status key**: 🔴 broken / emits wrong or uncompilable code · 🟠 silently does nothing ·
🟡 missing capability · ⚪ hygiene or documentation drift

## 1. Parquet.Net version support and .NET Framework

### 1.1 A `.V5` package would not restore net472 support 🟡

The assumption that a Parquet.Net 5.x-targeting variant retains .NET Framework support is
incorrect. TFMs as published:

| Parquet.Net | Ships `lib/` for | net472-capable |
|:---|:---|:---:|
| 6.0.3 | `net8.0`, `net10.0` | ✗ |
| 5.6.1 | `net8.0`, `net10.0` | ✗ |
| 4.25.0 | `netstandard2.0`, `netstandard2.1`, `net6.0`, `net8.0` | ✓ |
| 3.10.0 | `netstandard2.0`, `net5.0`, `net6.0` | ✓ |

**4.25.0 is the last net472-capable release.** Its dependency chain is netstandard2.0-clean
(IronCompress 1.5.2, Microsoft.Data.Analysis 0.21.1, Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream 3.0.1),
and its nuspec carries an explicit `.NETStandard2.0` dependency group pulling
`System.Threading.Tasks.Extensions` — .NET Framework consumption is deliberate, not accidental.

### 1.2 The API break is between v5 and v6, not v4 and v5 🟡

Comparing the public API in each package's shipped `Parquet.xml`:

| Concern | v4.25.0 / v5.6.1 | v6.0.3 |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Column write | `WriteColumnAsync(DataColumn, …)` | `WriteAsync<T>(DataField, ReadOnlyMemory<T>, …)` |
| Column read | `ReadColumnAsync(DataField, …) → DataColumn` | `ReadAsync<T>(DataField, Memory<T>, …)` |
| Writer disposal | `Dispose` (v5 adds `DisposeAsync`) | `DisposeAsync` |
| Reader disposal | `Dispose` only | `DisposeAsync` |
| Compression | `ParquetWriter.CompressionMethod` property | `ParquetOptions.CompressionMethod` |

v4 and v5 are one API family; v6 introduced the `Memory<T>` buffer API this generator is built on.

The consequence: **a `.V4` backend is not a retarget, it is a second emitter.** The upside is that
one `DataColumn`-based backend covers v4 *and* v5, and the same work unlocks net472. Suggested
naming is `Parquet.SourceGenerator.V4` (or `.Classic`) rather than `.V5`.

Emitter changes required for a classic backend:

- `WriteAsync<T>(field, memory)` → `WriteColumnAsync(new DataColumn(field, array))`
- `ReadAsync<T>(field, memory)` → `ReadColumnAsync(field)`, then read `.Data` / `.DefinedData`
- `await using` → `using` (no `DisposeAsync` on the v4 reader)
- Compression moves from `ParquetOptions` onto the writer

The ArrayPool zero-allocation story does not survive this — `DataColumn` allocates its own arrays —
so the classic package should not inherit the main package's performance claims.

### 1.3 net472 constraints beyond Parquet.Net itself 🟡

Three issues independent of which Parquet.Net version is chosen:

- The generated code uses `IAsyncEnumerable<T>` and `[EnumeratorCancellation]`, requiring
  `Microsoft.Bcl.AsyncInterfaces` and `System.Memory` on net472 — or those APIs must be `#if`'d out
  of the net472 emit.
- **IronCompress ships no `win-x86` native binary** (only `linux-x64`, `linux-arm64`, `osx-arm64`,
  `win-x64`). 32-bit .NET Framework applications fail at runtime on any compressed write. `runtimes/`
  RID assets also do not resolve at all under `packages.config`.
- `IsExternalInit` is `internal` in `Parquet.SourceGenerator.Attributes`, so net472 consumers using
  `init` accessors need their own copy.

### 1.4 The `IsExternalInit` polyfill missed netstandard2.1 ✅

`IsExternalInit` reached the BCL in .NET 5, so netstandard2.0 **and** netstandard2.1 both lack it.
The polyfill in the Attributes assembly was guarded on `#if NETSTANDARD2_0` alone, leaving the
netstandard2.1 target with no polyfill — the first `init` accessor or positional record added to
that assembly would have broken that one TFM and no other. Found while evaluating whether
`ParquetSerializerOptions` could become init-only (3.3); the guard now names both.

---

## 2. Correctness

### 2.1 `ReadParquetParallelAsync` performs no parallel work 🟠

`CodeEmitter.EmitReadParallelAsync` computes `targetParallelism` and never reads it again. The
emitted body is a sequential `for (int r = 0; r < rgCount; r++)` loop; the emitter contains no
`Task.Run`, `Parallel.For` or `Task.WhenAll` anywhere. Both the `maxDegreeOfParallelism` parameter
and `ParquetSerializerOptions.MaxDegreeOfParallelism` are inert.

The README ("Multi-core parallel read across row groups"), CHANGELOG ("distributes object
construction across row groups") and the generated XML doc comment all claim otherwise.

**Partially addressed.** The false claims are withdrawn — the emitted XML doc, README and CHANGELOG
now say it reads sequentially and that `maxDegreeOfParallelism` is not honoured — and the dead
`targetParallelism` local is gone. The behaviour is unchanged and the item stays open.

Why it was not simply "made parallel": the sequential form is a deliberate fix. A single
`ParquetReader` seeks within its `Stream`, so overlapping row-group reads corrupt one another. That
leaves two designs:

1. **Parallelise materialisation only** — decode each row group sequentially, then hand the
   `new T { … }` loop to the thread pool. Cheap to build, but the parallelised part is a tight loop
   of field copies while the sequential part does decompression and decoding. Amdahl's law caps the
   win at a few percent, and it buys that with thread-pool hops and buffer-ownership transfer out of
   the `ArrayPool` `finally`.
2. **One reader and one stream per worker** — parallelises decode, which is where the cost actually
   is. This is what a real parallel Parquet reader does, and it is the design worth building. It
   requires a seekable, shareable source, so it cannot be offered on an arbitrary `Stream`; the
   natural home is the `ReadOnlyMemory<byte>` overload (see 3.5), where each worker can cheaply get
   its own view over the same buffer.

Design 2 is the one to implement, scoped to the buffer and file overloads rather than the general
`Stream` one.

### 2.2 The read path reallocates its result list on every row group ✅

`EmitReadAsync` constructs `results` with capacity equal to the *total* row count, then emits
`results.Capacity = results.Count + rowCount;` inside the row-group loop. `List<T>.Capacity`
reallocates whenever the assigned value differs from the current backing array length, so each row
group allocates a smaller array and copies into it — repeatedly — before the list grows back.

Single-row-group files are unaffected. Multi-row-group files (exactly what `WriteParquetBatchedAsync`
produces) pay O(groups × rows) of copying. This is the most likely cause of the published benchmark
showing reads at 1.25× the reflection baseline's time with 2.36× its allocations.

### 2.3 Positional records emit uncompilable code ✅

The emitter always materialises via object initializer (`new {ClassName} { Prop = … }`). A positional
record synthesises a primary constructor and a copy constructor but **no parameterless constructor**,
so the emitted code fails with CS7036.

`[ParquetSerializable] public partial record Person(int Id, string Name);` — the shape used as the
example in `04-ROADMAP-AND-CONTRIBUTING.md` — is affected. No test covers a positional record; every
test model declares property bodies.

**Resolved** by `PARQ008`, which fires when a reference type has no accessible parameterless
constructor — covering positional records and any class whose only constructors take arguments.
Value types are exempt, since they always have one. Constructor-based materialisation was the richer
alternative but is a much larger change; rejecting the shape with a message that names the fix is
the honest interim.

### 2.4 Get-only properties and readonly fields emit uncompilable code ✅

`TargetParser` performs no settability check — there is no inspection of `SetMethod`, `IsReadOnly` or
`IsRequired`. A `public int Id { get; }` is collected and then assigned in an object initializer,
producing CS0200 inside generated code with no diagnostic pointing at the cause.

**Resolved** by `PARQ007`. A property needs a set or init accessor reachable from the generated
extension class — which sits beside the type rather than inside it, so `private` and `protected`
setters do not count — and a field must be neither `readonly` nor `const`.

### 2.5 Inherited members are silently dropped ✅

`TargetParser` uses `typeSymbol.GetMembers()`, which returns declared members only. A
`[ParquetSerializable]` type deriving from a base that carries columns loses every inherited member,
with no warning.

**Resolved** by walking `BaseType`. Two deliberate choices: the walk stops at the first base not
declared in source, so a model deriving from a framework type does not acquire `Exception.Data` and
friends as columns; and members are collected base-first with a derived declaration replacing a
shadowed base one *in the base's position*, so adding an `override` changes which declaration is
used without reordering the schema.

### 2.6 Nested and generic types are unhandled ✅

`ClassName` is `typeSymbol.Name`, so:

- A **nested type** emits a namespace-level extension class referencing an unqualified name that
  cannot resolve from that scope.
- A **generic type** emits `Foo` without its type parameters.
- The `AddSource` hint name is namespace + class name only, so two same-named nested types under one
  namespace collide — the same class of failure the namespace-qualification fix addressed.

**Resolved** with diagnostics rather than emission: `PARQ009` for nested types, `PARQ010` for
generic ones, and emission is suppressed for both. Supporting nested types is a genuine future
feature — the emitter would need to carry the containing-type path and flatten it into the extension
class name — but rejecting with a message that names the fix beats emitting code that does not
compile. Generic types are a harder no: the schema is a single `static readonly` field and cannot
vary by type argument.

### 2.7 `DateTimeOffset` is claimed but does not round-trip ✅

`TargetParser.ClassifyKind` maps `System.DateTimeOffset` to `PropertyKind.DateTime`, which emits a
`DateTimeDataField` whose CLR type is `DateTime`, while the write call is `WriteAsync<DateTimeOffset>`
over `ReadOnlyMemory<DateTimeOffset>`. The types disagree, and the offset would be lost even if the
call bound. There is no test coverage for `DateTimeOffset` anywhere in the repository.

**Resolved** by removing the mapping, so `DateTimeOffset` now reports as `PARQ006`. Parquet.Net's
`SupportedTypes` has no entry for it, and silently normalising to UTC would discard the offset
without the caller asking for that. Callers who want it should store a `DateTime` plus an explicit
offset column.

### 2.8 Unsupported property types fail at runtime, not compile time ✅

`ClassifyKind` funnels everything unrecognised into `PropertyKind.Primitive` and emits
`typeof(X)` for Parquet.Net to reject at runtime. Affected: `List<T>` and other collections, nested
POCOs, `char`, `sbyte`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, `DateOnly`, `TimeOnly`, `BigInteger`.

**Resolved** by `PARQ006`. The allowlist is mirrored from Parquet.Net 6's
`Parquet.Encodings.SchemaEncoder.SupportedTypes` rather than invented, so the diagnostic can never
fail a build that would otherwise have worked — an over-narrow list would have been worse than no
list at all. Unresolved (error) types are skipped rather than reported, so the rule stays quiet
while code is being typed.

Correcting the original finding: `byte`, `sbyte`, `short`, `ushort`, `uint`, `ulong`, `DateOnly`,
`TimeOnly` and `BigInteger` were listed here as failing, but Parquet.Net supports all of them and
they work through the passthrough today. What genuinely has no representation is `char`,
`DateTimeOffset`, arrays other than `byte[]`, collections, and nested user types.

### 2.9 Every reference-type column is forced nullable ✅

`TargetParser` computes `isNullable = memberType.IsReferenceType || NullableAnnotation == Annotated`.
A non-nullable `string Name` under `#nullable enable` therefore emits `isNullable: true`, so the
required/optional distinction is lost in the written schema. Downstream consumers (Spark, Athena,
PyArrow) do read that distinction.

**Resolved**: the annotation is now authoritative wherever the compilation has nullable analysis
switched on. In an oblivious context (`NullableAnnotation.None`) nothing can be inferred about a
reference type, so the conservative optional column is kept.

This is a **behaviour change**, and the one place in this series where a build that worked can start
failing at runtime: a `string Name` under `#nullable enable` now produces a *required* column, so
writing an actual null into it throws from Parquet.Net rather than being silently accepted. That is
the point — the annotation was a promise the schema was not recording — and it matches how EF Core
treats reference-type nullability. Declaring the member `string?` restores the optional column.

## 3. Options and API surface

### 3.1 `ParquetSerializerOptions` does nothing on any read path ✅

`EmitReadAsync`, `EmitReadParallelAsync` and `EmitReadStreamAsync` each emit
`options ??= …Default;` and then never reference `options` again — `ParquetReader.CreateAsync` is
called without it. Every setting silently no-ops on read.

**Resolved** by passing `BuildFormatOptions(options)` to all three `ParquetReader.CreateAsync`
calls. This is plumbing rather than a behaviour change today: `ParquetSerializerOptions` currently
carries only write-side settings, so the constructed `ParquetOptions` matches the reader's defaults.
What it buys is that any read-relevant option added later reaches the reader instead of being
silently dropped — see 3.7.

### 3.2 Row-group sizing uses a magic-number sentinel ✅

`options.RowGroupSize > 0 && options.RowGroupSize != 50_000 ? options.RowGroupSize : rowGroupSize`

Setting `RowGroupSize = 50_000` explicitly is indistinguishable from leaving it at its default, and
the method parameter silently wins. A nullable `int?` default expresses "unset" without a sentinel.
`MaxDegreeOfParallelism` uses the same `> 0` pattern.

**Resolved** for row-group sizing: the parameter is now `int?`, precedence is explicit argument →
options → the options default, and a non-positive value from either source throws
`ArgumentOutOfRangeException`. `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` is left alone deliberately — it is inert
until 2.1 is addressed, and giving it real precedence rules before it does anything would only
enshrine behaviour that does not exist.

### 3.3 `ParquetSerializerOptions.Default` is a mutable shared singleton ✅

`public static ParquetSerializerOptions Default { get; } = new();` exposes `{ get; set; }`
properties, so any consumer can mutate process-global defaults for every serializer in the
application.

**Resolved** by making `Default` return a fresh instance per access. Init-only properties were the
other candidate and were rejected: this assembly targets netstandard2.0/2.1, neither of which
carries `IsExternalInit`, so init-only would break object-initializer use for exactly the .NET
Framework consumers section 1 is about.

### 3.4 `SchemaName` is a dead public API ✅

`ParquetSerializableAttribute.SchemaName` is public and documented, is parsed by `TargetParser`, is
carried on `TargetClassModel` — and is never read by `CodeEmitter`. `TargetClassModel.IsRecord` and
`IsValueType` are likewise captured and unused.

**Resolved by removal.** It could not have been wired up: Parquet.Net's `ParquetSchema` has no name
to set — both constructors take fields and nothing else. `IsRecord` and `IsValueType` went with it.
Dead state on the model was not merely untidy: it still took part in the incremental pipeline's
equality comparison, so a change to any of it invalidated the cache and re-ran generation for no
difference in output.

### 3.5 Memory overloads are asymmetric, and one leaks 🟠

`ReadParquetAsync(ReadOnlyMemory<byte>)` constructs a `MemoryStream` it never disposes (CA2000).
It is also the only memory overload — `ReadParquetParallelAsync` and `ReadParquetStreamAsync` have
no equivalent.

**Leak resolved**: the method now awaits inside a `using`, keeping ownership where the stream is
created rather than handing it to a caller who never sees it. The asymmetry remains open, and is
where the real parallel reader should land (see 2.1).

### 3.6 `[ParquetColumn]` cannot express order without a name ✅

The attribute has only a name-taking constructor, so `[ParquetColumn(Order = 2)]` — reordering a
column without renaming it — is impossible.

**Resolved** with a parameterless constructor and a nullable settable `Name`. This uncovered a
second defect: the parser read named arguments *only when a constructor argument was also present*,
so even with a parameterless constructor the `Order` would have been silently ignored. `Name` is now
accepted as a named argument too.

### 3.7 `ParquetOptions.CompressionLevel` is not exposed ✅

`ParquetSerializerOptions` surfaces `CompressionMethod` but not the compression level Parquet.Net
accepts alongside it.

**Resolved** with a nullable `CompressionLevel`. Nullable rather than defaulted so "unspecified"
stays distinguishable from every legal value — the mistake 3.2 was about — and so an unset level
leaves Parquet.Net's own default (`SmallestSize`) in place instead of this generator quietly picking
one. The enum is declared locally rather than reusing `System.IO.Compression.CompressionLevel`,
whose `SmallestSize` member only exists from .NET 6 and so is not available to this assembly's
netstandard targets.

---

## 4. Documentation drift ⚪

- `CHANGELOG.md` states "Nothing has been released yet"; **0.0.1 is published on nuget.org**
  (alongside `0.0.1-dev.1` and `0.0.1-dev.2`).
- `CHANGELOG.md` lists `MaxDegreeOfParallelism` among options that are "all applied" (see 2.1).
- `README.md` says "Not benchmarked" three lines above an embedded benchmark table.
- `04-ROADMAP-AND-CONTRIBUTING.md` leaves phases 2–5 entirely unticked despite being shipped, and
  still lists "Update Parquet.Net to 4.x / 5.x" as pending while the repo targets 6.0.3.
- `release.yml`'s package-layout check verifies `netstandard2.0;netstandard2.1;net8.0` for the
  Attributes package, but the csproj also targets `net9.0`.
- `INDEX.md` says "Native AOT … Not yet verified — CI does not run an AOT publish", but `ci.yml`
  publishes and executes the AOT test binary on every run.

## 5. Remediation order

Sequenced so that each step is independently shippable and the cheap high-impact fixes land first.

| # | Item | Change |
|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | 2.2 | ✅ Removed the in-loop `Capacity` assignment |
| 2 | 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 | ✅ Threaded options through reads; dropped the sentinel; `Default` is now per-access |
| 3 | 2.1 | Implement real parallelism, or withdraw the claim and the parameter |
| 4 | 2.8 | ✅ `PARQ006`, allowlist mirrored from Parquet.Net's `SupportedTypes` |
| 5 | 2.3, 2.4 | ✅ `PARQ007` unassignable member, `PARQ008` no parameterless constructor |
| 6 | 2.6 | ✅ `PARQ009` nested, `PARQ010` generic |
| 7 | 2.5 | ✅ Walk base types for inherited members |
| 8 | 2.7, 2.9 | ✅ `DateTimeOffset` reported by `PARQ006`; nullable annotations honoured |
| 9 | 3.4, 3.6, 3.7 | ✅ `SchemaName` removed; order-only `[ParquetColumn]`; `CompressionLevel` |
| 10 | 4 | Reconcile documentation with behaviour |
| 11 | 1.2 | `Parquet.SourceGenerator.V4` classic backend + net472 target |

Items 4–6 are prerequisites for 11: the classic backend supports a narrower type set, so
compile-time rejection must exist before a second backend can report it.
